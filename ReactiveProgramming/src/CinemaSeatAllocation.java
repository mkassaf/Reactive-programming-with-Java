public class CinemaSeatAllocation {

    /*
        A cinema has n rows of seats, numbered from 1 to n and there are ten seats in each row, labelled from 1 to 10 as shown in the figure above.

        Given the array reservedSeats containing the numbers of seats already reserved, for example, reservedSeats[i] = [3,8] means the seat located in row 3 and labelled with 8 is already reserved.

        Return the maximum number of four-person groups you can assign on the cinema seats. A four-person group occupies four adjacent seats in one single row. Seats across an aisle (such as [3,3] and [3,4]) are not considered to be adjacent, but there is an exceptional case on which an aisle split a four-person group, in that case, the aisle split a four-person group in the middle, which means to have two people on each side.



        Example 1:



        Input: n = 3, reservedSeats = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,8],[2,6],[3,1],[3,10]]
        Output: 4
        Explanation: The figure above shows the optimal allocation for four groups, where seats mark with blue are already reserved and contiguous seats mark with orange are for one group.
        Example 2:

        Input: n = 2, reservedSeats = [[2,1],[1,8],[2,6]]
        Output: 2
        Example 3:

        Input: n = 4, reservedSeats = [[4,3],[1,4],[4,6],[1,7]]
        Output: 4


        Constraints:

        1 <= n <= 10^9
        1 <= reservedSeats.length <= min(10*n, 10^4)
        reservedSeats[i].length == 2
        1 <= reservedSeats[i][0] <= n
        1 <= reservedSeats[i][1] <= 10
        All reservedSeats[i] are distinct.
